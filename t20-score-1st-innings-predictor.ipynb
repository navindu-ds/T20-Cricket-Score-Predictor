    "For the test data in order to train the program, ball by ball data from the matches in the Indian Premier League (IPL) from the years 2008 - 2021 May have been used. Even though most of the matches are played in India and majority of players are from a single country, I have considered using this dataset to apply for International Matches (and other league matches) for a few reasons. \n",
    "* The matches span over a decade hence we have a very large number of match and overs scenarios.\n",
    "* Though all matches are played in India (barring some in South Africa and UAE) the variety in their own pitch conditions allow all type of scenarios.\n",
    "* The IPL provides a platform for both seasoned international players as well as young inexperienced players, hence we a large number of player profiles of all types of skills.\n",

    "\n",
    "In this model design, the program will select the cases which are similar to the inputted data such as based on the overs remaining and the wickets remaining. These two features are considered as the main two parameters that effect the availability of resources for a team to score a certain total of runs. This is the same idealogy adopted by the Duckworth-Lewis-Stern method in handling match scenarios with weather related interruptions. \n",

    "It is only with the selected data, the predictive model is built.\n",

    "Nevertheless, cricket is very unpredictable game which is one of the reasons it is such an enjoyable soprt to watch. Therefore more often than not match predictions will fluctuate as the match further progresses."
